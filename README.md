## What is Bix?

Bix is a CLI tool to store and manage you accounts and passwords.  
It encrypts and safely stores account credentials with your choice of AES flavor (128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit).

## Note
When it comes to safely storing passwords and other sensitive information, everyone has their own approach; and no matter which "foolproof" method you adopt, there will always be some form of risk involved.  
  
Bix is purely for convenience, and in my opinion, you must never solely rely on Bix (or any other digital password manager) to store all your account credentials for you.  
  
Instead, I would suggest a simple hybrid solution:  
**A digital password manager for convenience and a tangible password journal for confidence.**  
This way, you're not putting all your eggs in one basket.
